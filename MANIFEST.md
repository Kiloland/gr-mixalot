gr-mixalot is intended to be a set of GNU Radio blocks/utilities to encode pager messages. Currently it only supports POCSAG numeric and alphanumeric pages. It's also intended to be a fairly clear, short example of basic transmission with GNU Radio.

The POCSAG encoder has been tested against many variants of the Motorola Bravo and Advisor series, as well as the ATI Wireless CCP-6000. Please get in touch if you find a device that doesn't work properly.
